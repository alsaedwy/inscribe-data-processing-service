echo "📋 What happens now:"
echo "   • Every git commit will run these checks automatically"
echo "   • If any check fails, the commit will be blocked"
echo "   • You can run 'pre-commit run --all-files' to check all files manually"
echo "   • You can run 'pre-commit run <hook-name>' to run a specific hook"
echo ""
echo "🔧 Available commands:"
echo "   pre-commit run --all-files     # Run all hooks on all files"
echo "   pre-commit run black           # Run only black formatter"
echo "   pre-commit run flake8          # Run only flake8 linter"
echo "   pre-commit run pytest          # Run only unit tests"
echo "   pre-commit run isort           # Run only import sorting"
echo ""
echo "💡 Tips:"
echo "   • Use 'git commit --no-verify' to skip pre-commit hooks if needed"
echo "   • Run 'pre-commit run --all-files' before committing to catch issues early"
echo "   • See docs/PRE_COMMIT_SETUP.md for detailed usage instructions"

echo "📚 Next steps:"
echo "   1. Fix any flake8 or pytest issues reported above"
echo "   2. Run 'git add .' to stage any formatting changes"
echo "   3. Try making a test commit to see the hooks in action"
